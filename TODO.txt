2015:
  - Switch to postgresql (heroku hosted?)
  - Driver registration
  - Car registration
  - Event registration
  - Remove Teams
  - Remove Violation

- AERMiddleWare
  X Re-write now that we have a Rails project for the rest of the stuff.
  X grab lap number ($G, field index 3).
  X Create our own 'reset' that resends all $A & $COMP records.
    X But should also be able to handle Orbits cause I believe it can resend 
      any laps times that have been edited or added?
  X Whenever a driver is changed, save the last A_RECORD & C_RECORD.
    X I only save when the original values.
  - Call it server.resend?
    - Just sets a flag
    X Whenever a new lap comes across for each car, also send A & COMP records.
    X Also have an option to pass in car number?
      X So we'd need to save A & C records by car number.
      X This will only resend A & COMP records for 1 car.
  - I think we should log all incoming and outgoing messages.
    - better diagnostics.
  - WebUI wrapper for 
    - configuring
    - starting
    - stopping
    - resending
    - displaying incoming/outgoing messages
    - status/heartbeat?
      - running/not running...

- MotorsportReg import tool
  - reset/delete all existing?
  - nicer output of import stats.
  - possibly list changes or link to:
    - /admin/driver#history
    - /admin/car#history
    - /admin/team#history
  - look into RailsAdminImport gem
    - would have to re-write
    - would like to restrict it to certain pages.

- look through logs and possibly add indexes.

- Admin Console
  - setup Devise
  - setup CanCan

- go through and see where we can add laptimes.
  - teams
  - scans

- Pit IN import tool.
  - need stop_at on scans
  - can calculate stint lengths
  - can calculate pit stop lengths

- Some barcode printer import...
  X generate individual barcodes
  ~ bulk barcodes
    ~ might not be worth it because then we'd have to look through 100 of them.
  - Gotta discuss barcodes.

- LapTimes
  - graphs
  - lap number
  - filter by run group, car number, team, driver
  X need to add track length to event.
  X speed = distance / time
  X position
  X qualifying vs other

X Move rails_admin configs to models.

- Make violation_count and scan_count an offical column for Driver/Team?
  - it will make them sortable
  - easy to see who has most violations and most stints
  - belongs_to :owner, :polymorphic => true, :counter_cache => true

X Sum violations & scans on Team.
  X easy to see which team has the most violations/stints
  - might like those as sortable...

X Violations
  X make violations associated to Scan
  - need easier access from the Scans section.
  X association to Event through Scan

X Scans
  - add auto-refresh
  - Flag as practice, qualifying, race1, race2?
  - scopes by day & by session
  - add session: practice vs qualifying vs race1 & race2
  X Need stop_at (for when we do Scan at Pit IN).
  X Rename created_at to start_at

- Teams page
  - display fastest qualifying lap.
  - display fastest race lap.
  - display each driver & their fastest time.
  - display median lap time.
  - display median lap time for group(?)
  - display standard deviation for group(?)
  - stats by track status too?
  - graph
  - filter by run group.

- Driver's page
  - display fastest qualifying lap.
  - display fastest race lap.
  - display median lap time.
  - display standard deviation
  - stats by track status too?

- Event association
  - has_many_through for Driver, Team, Car?
  - figure out how to support multiple events.
    - that will make loading new data harder.
      - driver IDs should stay the same
      - car transponders can change @ each event (see rentals)
      - team names can change @ each evnet.
    - my just have a new database per event?

- figure out qualifying interface
  - look for NJMP example
  X output HTML
  X output CSV
  - need to calculate diffs.
  - need to graph

- Cell phones
  - Setting pit IN/OUT is lower case.  Need to either uppercase or make them
    case insensitive.
  - Network confirmation tool broke w/ the IP lookup.  So it was giving us a
    false negative.
  X Should have a setting for Practice, Qualifying, Race1, Race2.

X Eclipse running under AER account.

X On AERScan App, larger text for car # & driver.

- better scanners
  - check scanner volume
  - look for new scanners
  - confirm that you get a scan through phone
    - visual
    - audio 
  - lockout

- phone vibrate when you get valid scans.

- stronger omni-directional antenna for AP.

- qualifying
  - median
  - graphs
