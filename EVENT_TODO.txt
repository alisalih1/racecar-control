AT LOCATION:

- Get static IP address range.
- Set IP address of Orbits laptop.
- Set IP address of AER laptop.
- Point AER middleware to Orbits laptop IP address.
- Setup access point.
- Take cell phones out of airplane mode (or can i just turn on wifi & bluetooth)
- Set IP addresses for AER cell phones (actually, cell phones can be DHCP).
- Point AER cell phones to AER laptop IP address.
- Test cell phone connection.
- Orbits qualifying
- Orbits race1
- Orbits race2

LESSONS LEARNED:

- Make sure the AER laptop doesn't SLEEP!!!
  - Battery & Power Adapter.
- Make sure all power adapters are plugged in.
- Make sure registration can talk to AER laptop.
- Make sure PIT can talk to AER laptop.

- Communication to the track about WiFi setup.
  - WGI took us too literal.
  - We should diagram this.
  - 2 laptops in the tower
    - 1 running Orbits
    - 1 running AER software
    - Orbits laptop needs to communicate to AER laptop.
  - 1-2 laptops at registration
    - laptop(s) need to talk to AER laptop.
  - 1 cell phone using WiFi @ pit out.
    - needs to talk to AER laptop.
  - 1 cell phone using WiFi @ pit in (optional).
    - needs to talk to AER laptop.

- Need more than 1 person doing T&S setup.
  - Orbits needs to be loaded and confirmed.
    - Right now, adding team names is manual.
    - Visual inspection vs AER DB vs MotorsportReg
    - Lapping confirmation (car # matches when they cross the line)
      - Also that transponder is working.
    - Any team names that are truncated, need to be updated in:
      - Motorsport Reg (future imports)
      - AER software.
      - Writing our own Orbits export tool from the AER software will help this.
  - Need to make sure Motorsports Reg data matches reality.
    - Car & transponder numbers.
    - Update when necessary so it's easy to re-import data.
  - Need to confirm Race Monitor
  - WiFi confirmation/setup.
    - While the track is responsible for this it can either go very, very 
      smoothly or very, very badly.  With WGI, it went really, really badly.
